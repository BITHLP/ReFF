### Example:
ICECREAM

Answer:
Icy cold, a treat so sweet,
Creamy texture, can't be beat,
Easy to make, hard to resist,
Creamy dreamy, the perfect mist,
Raspberry swirls, a burst of flavor,
Every scoop, a moment to savor,
Amidst the heat, a cooling delight,
Melt in your mouth, oh so right!

### Example:
GEORGIANA

Answer:
Give me your patience, sister, while I frame
Exact in capitals your golden name;
Or sue the fair Apollo and he will
Rouse from his heavy slumber and instill
Great love in me for thee and Poesy.
Imagine not that greatest mastery
And kingdom over all the Realms of verse,
Nears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurse
And surety give to love and Brotherhood.
