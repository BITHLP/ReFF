### Instruction:
Please transcribe the following sentences into video subtitles. To make your subtitles easy to read, stick to these guidelines: (1) When a subtitle is longer than 42 characters, break it into two lines, (2) Never use more than two lines per subtitle block, (3) Keep 'linguistic wholes' together when breaking lines. Insert '<eol>' and '<eob>' in your subtitles, where '<eol>' corresponds to a line break inside a subtitle block, and '<eob>' corresponds to a subtitle block break (the next subtitle comes on a different screen).

### Example:
It's August 5, 2010

Answer:
It's August 5, 2010. <eob>
